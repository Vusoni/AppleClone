Apple Clone

This project is a modern, fully responsive Apple product page clone built using React.js and Tailwind CSS, designed to replicate the sleek, interactive user experience of Apple’s official website. It demonstrates advanced frontend development skills, including responsive layouts, dynamic content rendering, animations, and integration of 3D product models.

The layout is modern and clean, focusing on user experience and visual hierarchy, with sections such as:
	•	Hero Section: Highlights the main product with bold typography, call-to-action buttons, and immersive visuals.
	•	Performance Showcase: Displays product performance metrics with dynamic images and descriptive text.
	•	Masonry Feature Layout: Presents product features in a visually engaging, grid-style format.
	•	3D Product Viewer: Uses GLB models rendered on <canvas> for interactive product exploration.
	•	Custom Tailwind Utilities: Includes reusable classes for typography, spacing, flex layouts, and animations.
	•	Dynamic Footer: Features links, copyright information, and automatically updates the year.

This project not only replicates Apple’s modern website aesthetic but also serves as a hands-on demonstration of modern front-end technologies, including React component architecture, Tailwind CSS customization, and interactive UI/UX patterns. It’s ideal for portfolios, UI/UX experimentation, or learning advanced web development techniques.

Whether you are exploring responsive design, 3D product visualization, or interactive animations, this project provides a comprehensive example of combining modern web technologies to create a polished, production-ready UI.

## ⚡ Technologies Used

- **React.js** – Frontend library for building UI components.
- **Tailwind CSS** – Utility-first CSS framework for rapid styling.
- **GLB / 3D models** – For interactive product views.
- **JavaScript ES6+** – Logic and interactivity. - You can adjust it and use TypeScript if you want but i've decided to keep it simple.
